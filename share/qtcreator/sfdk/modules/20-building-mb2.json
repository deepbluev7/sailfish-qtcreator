    "trDescription": "INTRODUCTION\n\nStart by choosing the build target. List the available build tools.\n\n$ sfdk tools list\n%{OsVariant:NoSpace}-3.0.0.8\n└─%{OsVariant:NoSpace}-3.0.0.8-i486\n%{OsVariant:NoSpace}-3.0.2.8\n├─%{OsVariant:NoSpace}-3.0.2.8-armv7hl\n└─%{OsVariant:NoSpace}-3.0.2.8-i486\n\nEach build target lets you build software for a specific operating system version running on a specific hardware. Each target is listed under one tooling supporting the given OS version (see MANAGING SDK BUILD TOOLS below for more information).\n\nAs with other configuration options, you can decide if you want to apply your choice globally (with the '--global' option) or just for the current (shell) session. Let's exercise both options. Pick the latest ARM target for global use and its i486 counterpart for this session only.\n\n$ sfdk config --global --push target %{OsVariant:NoSpace}-3.0.2.8-armv7hl\n$ sfdk config --push target %{OsVariant:NoSpace}-3.0.2.8-i486\n\nNow review what we have configured.\n\n$ sfdk config\n# ---- command scope ---------\n# <clear>\n\n# ---- session scope ---------\ntarget = %{OsVariant:NoSpace}-3.0.2.8-i486\n\n# ---- global scope ---------\n# masked at session scope\n;target = %{OsVariant:NoSpace}-3.0.2.8-armv7hl\n\nOptions pushed higher on the stack override (mask) those appearing lower - as stated conveniently in the output.\n\nEnter a project directory and perform an all-in-one build procedure using the 'build' command. If you don't have an existing project available, you can create one as in the following example.\n\n$ mkdir my-app && cd my-app\n$ sfdk init --type qtquick\n$ sfdk build\n\nAfter successful build the resulting RPM package(s) can be found under the RPMS directory.\n\n$ ls ./RPMS\nmy-app-0-1.i486.rpm\n\nIt is possible to invoke each build phase separately.\n\n$ sfdk qmake\n$ sfdk make\n$ sfdk make-install\n$ sfdk package\n\nAfter all pick a device from those configured inside the %{IdeVariant} (Qt Creator) and deploy the package.\n\n$ sfdk device list\n#0 \"%{OsVariant} Emulator 3.1.0.12\"\n    emulator         autodetected  nemo@127.0.0.1:2223\n    private-key: ~/%{OsVariant:NoSpace}/vmshare/ssh...%{OsVariant:Underline}-Emulator-latest/nemo\n#1 \"Xperia 10 - Dual SIM (ARM)\"\n    hardware-device  user-defined  nemo@192.168.2.15:22\n    private-key: ~/%{OsVariant:NoSpace}/vmshare/ssh...Xperia_10_-_Dual_SIM_(ARM)/nemo\n$ sfdk config --push device \"%{OsVariant} Emulator 3.1.0.12\"\n$ sfdk deploy --sdk\n\n\nSHADOW BUILDS\n\nShadow builds can be initiated simply by passing project file or directory path to the 'build' or 'qmake' (or 'cmake') command:\n\n$ mkdir build && cd build\n$ sfdk build ../path/to/sources\n\nOr manually invoking each step:\n\n$ mkdir build && cd build\n$ sfdk qmake ../path/to/sources\n$ sfdk make\n$ sfdk rpm\n\nLimitations related to shadow builds:\n\n1. Shadow build is only available for packages that use qmake (or CMake or GNU Automake).  Additionally, their build and install procedure must be fully realized using qmake (or CMake or GNU Automake) with no additional steps implemented at .spec level.\n2. The \"--doprep\" option to the \"build\" command cannot be used with shadow builds.\n3. If \"prep\" or \"apply\" is needed, it must be used directly on the source tree prior to starting a shadow build (shadow builds for multiple targets are still possible provided that the %prep section is target-independent).\n4. GNU Automake, Autoconf and related tools, in case of packages that invoke these at build time, still store their outputs (Makefile.in, configure, etc.) under the source tree.\n\n\nSHARED OUTPUT DIRECTORY\n\nWith shared output directory, it is possible to deploy all required packages built from different sources more conveniently. This can be achieved with the 'output-dir' configuration option or even better with the combination of 'output-prefix' and 'task' options.  Consider enabling 'output-prefix' and 'task' by default to get build results grouped by the tasks they are related to.  By default, the task will be determined based on the current Git branch - check the description of the 'task' option for more details:\n\n$ sfdk config --global --push output-prefix ~/RPMS\n$ sfdk config --global --push task\n\n$ sfdk config --push target my-target\n$ cd packageA\n$ git checkout -b bug12345\n$ sfdk build\n$ cd ../packageB\n$ git checkout -b bug12345\n$ sfdk build\n\n$ ls -1 ~/RPMS/bug12345/my-target/\n$ sfdk deploy --manual --all \\\n      && sfdk device exec sudo zypper -p RPMS -v dup\n\nWith these options the output directory is also searched for build-time dependencies by default, so if packageB requires packageA at build time, you do not need to install packageA manually to the build target.\n\nNote that it can be usefull to also pass '--from ~plus-repo-1' to 'zypper dup'.\n\n\nCLEAN BUILDS\n\nIt is possible to avoid polluting build targets with build time dependencies of a particular package by using the 'snapshot' configuration option. With this option the build target is not used directly. Instead a snapshot is taken and the build is done using the snapshot of the build target. See the description of the 'snapshot' option for details on how the snapshot is chosen.\n\nThe snapshot will be reset automatically whenever the original build target is updated, so if e.g. a locally built package is needed as a build-time dependency, instead of installing it manually you should rely on the above mentioned fact that with custom output directory the 'search-output-dir' option is implied, and combine the 'snapshot' option with the 'output-prefix' option.\n\nFor similar reasons, when sfdk fails to install build-time dependencies due to errors like \"file not found on the server\", i.e., because the local repository cache got outdated, it is the original target that should be updated, not the snapshot.\n\nConsider enabling 'snapshot' by default as well:\n\n$ sfdk config --global --push output-prefix ~/RPMS\n$ sfdk config --global --push task\n$ sfdk config --global --push snapshot\n\nIn order to ensure targets are not polluted by running sfdk without the 'snapshot' option unintentionally, sfdk requires to use 'no-snapshot' explicitly once at least one snapshot exists for a target. Existing snapshots can be listed and removed using the 'tools' command just like the ordinary targets.\n\n\nMAINTAINING CHANGELOGS\n\nIf a file exists with '.changes' extension, otherwise matching the spec file name, the effect will be the same as having a %changelog section in the spec file. If a file with '.changes.run' extension is found instead, this file will be executed and its output treated as the actual change log.",

This can be overridden with '--refresh' - do not use unless you know what you are doing. If refresh is needed, refresh (and update) the original target instead, then do 'reset'.\n\nThe 'reset' command can only be used together with the 'snapshot' configuration option, with the effect of resetting the target snapshot forcefully to the (possibly updated) state of the original target first, pulling later."
