    "trDescription": "QUALITY ASSURANCE\n\nCertain quality checks may be performed with the help of the 'check' command:\n\n$ cd package\n$ sfdk build\n$ sfdk check\n\nThe command enables execution of (pluggable) test suites, each realizing testing on one or more of the four recognized test levels:\n\n1. Static testing (verification) performed on the source tree\n\n2. Static testing (verification) performed on the build results (packages)\n\n3. Dynamic testing (validation) performed at build host (unit testing)\n\n    Testing at this level is only supported with the built-in suite 'rpmspec', that executes the steps defined by the '%check' section of the RPM .spec file if present.\n\n    Testing at this level is normally performed by the 'build' and 'package' commands (unless used with the '--no-check' option) and so it is not enabled by default for this command. Performed with this command, it involves execution of the 'make-install' command.\n\n4. Dynamic testing (validation) performed on a target device (system testing)\n\n    The 'check' command does not include the deployment step. Package(s) need to be deployed to the device selected with the 'device' configuration option beforehand, possibly with the 'deploy' command in case of packages associated with the build tree under CWD.\n\nThe available test suites may be listed with the '--list-suites' option to the 'check' command.\n\nSee the 'check' command to learn how to override the default selection of test levels, suites and artefacts.",

The effect of multiple patterns is cumulative, evaluated from left to right.  The very first pattern determines whether it starts by removing from the full list or by adding to an empty list.  Extended, Bash-compatible patterns are allowed.  The '-*-debug@(info|source)' pattern is implied unless the '--debug' option is used.  (Note: '--debug' is not needed for successfull debugging with the 'debug' command as that command uses the local debug information.)  Options must precede patterns if any.\n\nThe following deployment methods are available, corresponding to the mandatory option:\n\n--pkcon\n    Uses 'pkcon' to install RPM package(s).  Does not require root access to the device.  Not all device operating system versions and configurations permit use of this method.\n\n--rsync\n    This method is special.  Uses 'rsync' to copy the installed files under '/opt/sdk/<name>' without building/installing RPM package(s).  Does not require root access to the device.  Incompatible with '--all'.\n\n--sdk\n    Uses the method native to the SDK to install RPM package(s). Requires developer mode enabled on the device, does not require root access.\n\n--zypper\n    Uses 'zypper' to install RPM package(s).  Requires 'zypper' installed on the device, requires root access to the device.\n\n--manual\n    Only transfers the RPM package(s) to the device for manual installation. Uses '~/RPMS' as the target directory on the device."
