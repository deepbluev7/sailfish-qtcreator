    "trDescription": "=== Quality Assurance\n\nCertain quality checks may be performed with the help of the 'check' command:\n\n    $ cd package\n    $ sfdk build\n    $ sfdk check\n\nThe command enables execution of (pluggable) test suites, each realizing testing on one or more of the four recognized test levels:\n\n1. Static testing (verification) performed on the source tree\n\n2. Static testing (verification) performed on the build results (packages)\n\n3. Dynamic testing (validation) performed at build host (unit testing)\n+\n--\n\nTesting at this level is only supported with the built-in suite 'rpmspec', that executes the steps defined by the '%check' section of the RPM .spec file if present.\n\nTesting at this level is normally performed by the 'build' and 'package' commands (unless used with the '--no-check' option) and so it is not enabled by default for this command. Performed with this command, it involves execution of the 'make-install' command.\n\n--\n\n4. Dynamic testing (validation) performed on a target device (system testing)\n+\n--\n\nThe 'check' command does not include the deployment step. Package(s) need to be deployed to the device selected with the 'device' configuration option beforehand, possibly with the 'deploy' command in case of packages associated with the build tree under CWD.\n\n--\n\nThe available test suites may be listed with the '--list-suites' option to the 'check' command.\n\nSee the 'check' command to learn how to override the default selection of test levels, suites and artefacts.",

            "trDescription": "Deploy build results to the configured device (see the 'device' configuration option).\n\nBy default, just the build results of the project under current working directory will be deployed. When a shared output directory is used (see 'output-dir' and 'output-prefix' configuration options), the option '--all' can be used to require deployment of all packages, no matter of their origin. The '--all' option is not available when the '--rsync' method is used.\n\nWith the '--dry-run' option, the list of (sub)packages that would be deployed may be previewed without applying the changes.  Depending on the selected deployment method, the packages may still get transferred to the device.\n\nSelection of (sub)packages for deployment can be influenced with glob <pattern>s, each of which may be preceded with '+' or '-' to opt for either inclusion (default) or exclusion respectively as the desired effect.  The effect of multiple patterns is cumulative, evaluated from left to right.  The very first pattern determines whether it starts by removing from the full list or by adding to an empty list.  Extended, Bash-compatible patterns are allowed.  The '-*-debug@(info|source)' pattern is implied unless the '--debug' option is used.  (Note: '--debug' is not needed for successfull debugging with the 'debug' command as that command uses the local debug information.)  Options must precede patterns if any.\n\nThe following deployment methods are available, corresponding to the mandatory option:\n\n--pkcon::\n+\n--\nUses 'pkcon' to install RPM packages.  Not all device operating system versions and configurations permit use of this method.\n--\n\n--rsync::\n+\n--\nThis method is special.  It can be used to transfer the RPM \"buildroot\" to the device as '/opt/sdk/<name>' without building and installing RPM packages (see also 'make-install'). Incompatible with '--all'.\n--\n\n--sdk::\n+\n--\nUses the method native to the SDK to install RPM packages. Requires developer mode enabled on the device.\n--\n\n--zypper::\n+\n--\nUses 'zypper' to install RPM packages.  Requires 'zypper' installed on the device. Requires root access to the device.\n--\n\n--zypper-dup::\n+\n--\nUses 'zypper dup' to install RPM packages.  Requires 'zypper' installed on the device.  Requires root access to the device.\n\nThis method allows to deploy updates to platform packages conveniently.  With platform packages, subpackages specific to a particular device variant often exist, so a careful selection of subpackages to install is needed.  Compared to the '--zypper' method, which uses 'zypper in' and so fully relies on the user to select packages to install, the '--zypper-dup' method is capable of figuring out the right subset of packages automatically in many cases.\n--\n\n--manual::\n+\n--\nOnly transfers the RPM packages to the device for manual installation. Uses '~/RPMS' as the target directory on the device.\n--\n\nWhen \"Requires root access to the device\" is stated, the device will be accessed as the 'root' user instead of the configured user. Other connection parameters remain unchanged."

For that it is vital that the host name is stable and unique among the host names recorded by packages installed from other sources.
